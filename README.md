### The application of Blockchain in field of finance
### Why is blockchain trustworthy?
To a certain extent, the block chain can be understood as a replicable and shared account book. The core innovation of Bitcoin: it teaches the world how to transfer value over long distances without trusting third parties. And it relies on a consensus mechanism.
Of course, physical paper money can be transferred face to face, but before Bitcoin, we could not: transfer value to someone over long distances without the need to trust centralised third-party institutions (post offices, banks, etc.).
In this way, the infrastructure of the traditional transfer model of banks and payment systems is restructured into a peer-to-peer payment network. 
This shift is shown in the following figureï¼š

Bitcoin opens the door to a peer-to-peer electronic value transfer model, completely different from the current banking system, central bank and payment system. 
However, the above diagram does not explain how Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer value transfer. 
The answer is: the bitcoin system is based on "replicable, shared books". 
Each participant (full node) in the bitcoin network has a complete copy of the transaction ledger, and the magic of the system is how it makes everyone's copy consistent with that of others. 
Therefore, the correct schematic diagram should be the following figure, where each participant can obtain information from the same replicable, shared ledger.
